# HMM
Script for solving Scoring, Decoding and Learning HMM problems with GUI for input and output
# How to start
Run GUI1
# Main Code
mainCode.py contains the algoithms for solving Scoring-solo, Scoring-paired, and Decoding problems.
The module for saving and retrieving variables across scripts is also included here .
# GUI 1
user defines the observations and events.
# GUI 2
Transmission and Emission matrices with appropriate sizes are created. user inputs the probabilities.

 ** Initialization matrix is included in the generated Transmission Matrix.
 
 ** Since in some problems termination event matters, Termination matrix is also included in the generated Transmission Matrix.
 
 ** if user wishes define the parameters of the problem without termination event probabilities, he/she would simply 
    input 1 in (event => end) boxes inside the Transmission matrix.
    
 ** ofc, (start => end) boxes inside the Transmission matrix should always be 0.
# GUI 3
user choses what type of problem to solve. then, the observation sequence and/or event sequence based on the problem type are generated by the user.
the chosen problem with the input parameters will be solved.
